 Medical Image Diagnosis with Deep Learning

 Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning and medical imaging to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray scans. Using the **Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset** from Kaggle, a **transfer learning-based CNN model** (MobileNetV2) is trained to classify images into `Normal` and `Pneumonia` categories.
